# Replayefficiency
A Python script for Tetrio replay files (.ttrm) which displays your total attacks, pieces placed, and attacks per piece. 
Created this because I wanted to know APS and couldn't find how to see it in Tetrio

## Instructions:
(Must have python installed, it is a python script!)
1. Put the python script in the same folder as the replay you want to analyse
2. rename the replay input.ttrm
3. run the file (just double click, should work if you have python installed)
4. profit
